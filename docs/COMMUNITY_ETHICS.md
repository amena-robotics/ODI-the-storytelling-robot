# Community ethics & data governance framework

ODI is built **with** communities, not **for** them.

---

### Tiered consent framework

**Level 1: Restricted (TK sacred)**
- Story stored on IPFS (immutable)
- Access limited to community members
- No AI generation/modification allowed
- Archival only (playback mode)

**Level 2: TK Educational**
- Shared with educators & researchers
- Can be used with RAG (contextual selection)
- Attribution required
- Academic use only

**Level 3: TK General (community use with Conditions)**
- Can be shared within broader networks (not public)
- Community sets specific conditions for use
- Attribution required

**Level 4: Public domain**
- Public release permitted
- Can be used in generative mode
- Derivative works allowed
- Attribution required

## Data governance workflow

1. **Acquisition** – Story upload with consent selection
2. **Verification** – Smart contract confirms consent level
3. **Storage** – IPFS archive (immutable record)
4. **Access control** – Fleek interface enforces access rights
5. **Usage** – Robot respects consent tier during storytelling

## Community benefits

- **Sovereignty**: Communities control their cultural output
- **Preservation**: Immutable backup ensures stories cannot be lost
- **Monetisation**: Communities can opt into sharing if desired
- **Attribution**: Story sources are always credited

## Legal & ethical review

This framework has been reviewed and approved by:

- **Institution**: [Camberwell](https://www.arts.ac.uk/research/research-standards-and-ethics), University of the Arts London
- **Research Standards**: Compliant with [UAL Research Standards & Ethics](https://www.arts.ac.uk/research/research-standards-and-ethics)
- **Review Date**: [Nov/2025]

### Institutional ethics review

ODI's community data governance framework follows the ethical standards established by University of the Art Londons' Research Standards & Ethics department, ensuring:

- Community consent is voluntary and informed
- Data ownership remains with communities
- Privacy protections meet institutional requirements
- Transparent documentation of all agreements
- Mechanisms for community members to revoke consent
- Regular review cycles to ensure compliance
