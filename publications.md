**Chapter**: "ODI: a storytelling robots for cultural preservation"

### Abstract

Introducing ODI (Omnidirectional Dynamic Interactor), a multi-functional mobile robot designed to share and preserve traditional stories through a unique form of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Stories not only shape how we relate to each other and our world [1] but are valuable assets of our cultural heritage that need to be protected. ODI integrates real-time environmental perception and emotion detection to guide responsive and situated storytelling experiences that combine Large Language Model (LLM) narrative generation with AI projected imagery. This paper explores the potential for developing an adaptive storytelling robot and details the design considerations, ethics, sustainability, wider applications and the technical process to create ODI.
