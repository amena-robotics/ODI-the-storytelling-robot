## Overview

ODI is a storytelling robot designed to preserve indigenous languages and cultural narratives through participatory AI, with full community data ownership and privacy protection.

Each story is preserved immutably on IPFS, with control remaining with the community. The robot adapts its storytelling mode based on hierarchal architecture (playback → RAG → generation) + decentralized IPFS storage + emotion-aware interaction.
